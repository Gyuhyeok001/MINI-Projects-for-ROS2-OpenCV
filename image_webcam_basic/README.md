# ROS2 Image Subscriber with OpenCV

< A basic computer vision project for autonomous driving using ROS2 + Python + OpenCV >

This project demonstrates how to subscribe to an image topic in ROS2 and process it in real time using OpenCV to convert the image to grayscale.

---

## Features

- `image_pub_node`: Publishes a fixed image (`test_image.jpg`) repeatedly to the `/image_raw` topic
- `image_sub_node`: Subscribes to `/image_raw`, converts the image to grayscale using OpenCV, and displays it

---

## Environment

- Ubuntu 22.04
- ROS2 Humble
- Python 3.10
- OpenCV + cv_bridge
- VS Code (optional)

---

## How to Run

### 1. Build the ROS2 workspace

cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
