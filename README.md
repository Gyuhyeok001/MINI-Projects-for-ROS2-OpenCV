# MINI-Projects-for-ROS2-OpenCV 

This repository contains basic and intermediate level mini projects using **ROS2** and **OpenCV**, focused on autonomous robotics and perception.

These projects are designed to help me (Gyuhyeok Lee) build a practical foundation in self-driving car technology, especially in the areas of computer vision, camera input handling, object tracking, and ROS2 communication.

---

## Skills Practiced

- Python programming (OpenCV, NumPy)
- ROS2 (rclpy, publisher/subscriber model)
- Real-time camera input handling
- Object detection and tracking
- Image processing pipelines for robotics

## Projects

###  1. `image_webcam_basic`
 A basic ROS2 node that reads images or webcam streams and displays them using OpenCV.

- Topics covered:
  - Reading from camera or image file
  - Displaying frames in real time
  - ROS2 publisher/subscriber
- ðŸ›  Tools: ROS2, Python, OpenCV

### 2. `red_ball_tracking`
 A ROS2-based color tracking project that detects a red-colored ball from a webcam feed.

- Topics covered:
  - HSV color filtering
  - Contour detection and centroid tracking
  - ROS2 real-time image subscriber
  - Tools: ROS2, OpenCV, Python

---

## Future Additions
I plan to expand this repository with more robotics-related mini projects, including:

- Line following with OpenCV & ROS2
- YOLOv5-based object detection
- SLAM and ROS2 Navigation2 demo
